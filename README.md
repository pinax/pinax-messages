[Pinax](http://pinaxproject.com/pinax/) is an open-source platform built on the
Django Web Framework. It is an ecosystem of reusable Django apps, themes, and
starter project templates.

This app is part of the Pinax ecosystem and is designed for use both with and
independently of other Pinax apps.

## pinax-messages

## History

This app was formerly named `user-messages` but was renamed after being donated to Pinax from Eldarion.

In case of any questions we recommend you [join our Pinax Slack team](http://slack.pinaxproject.com) and ping us there instead of creating an issue on GitHub. Creating issues on GitHub is of course also valid but we are usually able to help you faster if you ping us in Slack.

We also highly recommend reading our [Open Source and Self-Care blog post](http://blog.pinaxproject.com/2016/01/19/open-source-and-self-care/).
